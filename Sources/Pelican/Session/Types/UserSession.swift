/**
A high-level class for managing states and information for each user that attempts to interact with your bot
(and that isn't immediately blocked by the bot's blacklist).  Features embedded permission lists populated by Moderator,
the chat sessions the user is actively participating in and other key pieces of information.

UserSession is also used to handle InlineQuery and ChosenInlineResult routes, as only UserSessions will receive inline updates.
