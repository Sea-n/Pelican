/** 
Defines a class that handles the creation, coordination and execution of delayed Telegram API calls inside a chat session.
Useful when preparing sequences of messages to be sent out in order to present language and information in a steadier
and more natural manner.  

This is designed as a simple content scheduler and not a full dispatch/job system currently.  For that look to other
frameworks such as Jobs - https://github.com/BrettRToomey/Jobs.
